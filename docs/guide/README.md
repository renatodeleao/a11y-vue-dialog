## Why another modal/dialog plugin

- âœ… Accessibility first â€” Focus trap + keyboard navigation + aria-attributes
- âœ… Fully controlled component
- âœ… Pure vue, no wrapping.
- âœ… Simplicity + size
- ðŸ•¸ Nested dialogs ([questionable pattern](https://github.com/edenspiekermann/a11y-dialog#nested-dialogs), not recommended, but possible because [it happens](https://cl.ly/be43f69393f7))
- ðŸš§ _renderless version_


## Why Not ...?

My inspiration for this package was accessibility-first. There are a lot of vue dialog/modals out there that treat accessibility as sideeffect not a feature. A11y-vue-dialog provides you an out-of-the-box accessible dialog, with just enought functionallity to get you running in seconds, and just enough props and events to make it adaptable to any usecase.

There are a lot of dialog/modal plugins out there, if your looking for a fully fledged plugin, theres a list in the thanks you section that might help :)
